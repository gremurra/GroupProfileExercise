        Before getting into the world of software development my life revolved around sports media, specifically as a radio broadcaster for Indiana University Athletics. In March 2020, my journey in sports was turned upside-down during the COVID-19 outbreak. As I looked for a new chapter in my professional life, I instantly got hooked on software development and coding. The logic behind the technology, the processes that make applications run smoothly. It all fascinated me.

        I took a chance, and have enrolled in the .NET Software Development Program at Eleven Fifty Academy in Indianapolis, Indiana.  So far in the course, I've gained a wide range of knowledge using HTML5, CSS and C# languages. Upon graduating from Eleven Fifty in June, I look forward to using my creativity and problem-solving  skills to advance your business.
