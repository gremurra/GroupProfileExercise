  <p>With my formal training as an Industrial Engineer, I stumbled upon coding and development while looking for a career change. I have always been the type of person who likes to solve problems and be challenged, and software development became my means to develop new skills and grow in a dynamic environment.

With completing Eleven Fifty Academyâ€™s Software Development Course, I was able to find a platform to exercise my skills in problem solving and detail oriented results. Although I am new to developing, I am yearning to gain experience in areas that highlight my aptitude and creativity.

My training with software developing has been challenging, but I am working hard to become the best developer I can be and am looking forward to a successful career in this industry.</p>

<h1>Seth McLaughlin</h1>
<p>I'm a programmer. It's what I do. I mean it's not the only thing I do. I do other things, too.

    For example, I read. I don't usually like fiction, though. So, if I'm reading, you'll probably find me nose deep in a book about software development or HTML. I also enjoy video games! Though, I mainly play on the PC. I even built my computer for a better game play experience.
    
    Okay, I admit it. Most of my life revolves around computers and how to enhance them. What can I say? I love technology!
    
    In fact, I previously worked at Indiana University in the IT Department. My goal is to use my work experience and education as a firm foundation to further my understanding of the various fields of technology. I hope to eventually expand my expertise to machine learning and AI.
    
    I'm kind of a nerd, but you can't control what you love.</p>
