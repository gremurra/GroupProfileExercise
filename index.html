  <p>With my formal training as an Industrial Engineer, I stumbled upon coding and development while looking for a career change. I have always been the type of person who likes to solve problems and be challenged, and software development became my means to develop new skills and grow in a dynamic environment.

With completing Eleven Fifty Academyâ€™s Software Development Course, I was able to find a platform to exercise my skills in problem solving and detail oriented results. Although I am new to developing, I am yearning to gain experience in areas that highlight my aptitude and creativity.

My training with software developing has been challenging, but I am working hard to become the best developer I can be and am looking forward to a successful career in this industry.</p>
